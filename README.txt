LuxeWatchCo (Class Project) — Static Website
===========================================

What you have:
- A simple multi-page static website (HTML/CSS/JS).
- Works offline: open index.html.
- For a public link, host it on GitHub Pages or Netlify (free).

Option A: GitHub Pages (fast)
1) Create a GitHub repo (e.g., luxewatchco).
2) Upload ALL files in this folder.
3) In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main / root.
4) Your public link will look like: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/luxewatchco/

Option B: Netlify (drag & drop)
1) Go to Netlify and log in.
2) Drag the entire folder (or zip) into "Deploy manually".
3) Netlify will give you a live URL instantly.

Using your custom domain (luxewatchco.com)
- Buy the domain from a registrar (Namecheap/GoDaddy/Google Domains etc.).
- In GitHub Pages or Netlify, add the custom domain and follow the DNS instructions.
- DNS changes can take a little time to propagate.
